The assignments are designed using 'Constructive Alignment' principles - meaning the grading approach is bound to the learning objectives of the module.



So, for this assignment, you can think of the spec as have 4 key aspects.


(1) api

(2) api tests

(3) new features

(4) front end 

To elaborate:



(1) Expose features developed in assignment 1 as set of REST endpoints.


(2) A comprehensive unit tests for (1)


(3) Progressing beyond the assignment 1 features, there are some indications as to the scope of the new features under the 'POI Social' suggestions. I will be happy to review alternative features you might like to pursue..


(4) Enhance the UI to showcase the new features - with specific reward for interactive maps.
 In developing (4) the maximum reward would be to demonstrate Aurelia front end. 

If time is an issue - then you may continue to develop using server rendered approached from assignment 1. However, this will earn a lesser reward. 

This is largely encapsulated in the grading guidlines - along with a few additional aspects.

 

On Aurelia - I am due to post one more lab on Aurelia Deployment. I will try to get this out over the next day or so. It will be quite short - as it is fairly easy to do.

Hope this helps.
